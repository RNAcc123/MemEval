Therefore, the answer is based on the closest relevant memory, but it pertains to Melanie, not Caroline. \n\nIf you have additional memories or context about Caroline's activities after the road trip, please provide them for a more accurate answer. \n\nFinal Answer (based on available memories): \"No info on Caroline.\" \n\n(Note: The memories only mention Melanie's relaxation activity after the road trip, not Caroline's.)",
