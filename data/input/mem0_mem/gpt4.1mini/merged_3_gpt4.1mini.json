The memories do not specify the exact adoption date of Buddy, but the latest prior mention of Buddy is October 19, 2023, and Scout is adopted by November 22, 2023. Given that months are counted in whole units and Buddy was adopted before October 19, 2023, and Scout around November 22, 2023, the time passed is roughly 1 month or less.\n\nAnswer: 1 month",
