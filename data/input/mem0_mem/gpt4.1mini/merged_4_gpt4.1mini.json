However, the closest hint is that by early May, James was interested in a CS:GO tournament, and John participated in a CS:GO tournament in late March. The memories suggest that James’s April tournament might not have been CS:GO but something else. No explicit game is named for James’s April tournament play.\n\nTherefore, there is no clear explicit mention of the specific game James played in the April 2022 tournament in the memories provided.\n\nAnswer: Not specified",
